Mobile development end_term project "Recipe Mobile Application" (React Native)

For the mobile development end-term project, I have implemented a food recipe application 
named “Dino Culinary” that shares recipes from an open API that is free to access. The API 
is retrieved from the “TheMealDB” website which provides free data source API for recipes 
online. 

My food recipe application works on both IOS and Android devices. I have undergone 
several stages when implementing this application to make sure that my application is 
accessible and easy to use.
